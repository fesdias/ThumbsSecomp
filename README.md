# Thumbs Secomp
Project developed to generate cover images (Thumbnails) for the videos published on YouTube from the Unicamp Computing Week (SECOMP). 

## Sobre
From creative arts (images) developed for social networks, the algorithm adapts these images to the horizontal format, generating a darker background with image blur, an extra layer defined by a .png image (SECOMP-lines.png) and the image itself in front.
